# About AXUI

## Product Definition

The AXUI front-end framework is built on HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript standards, with TypeScript used for type management. It has no library dependencies and is designed to meet diverse needs with a focus on design.

AXUI aims to provide comprehensive components and modules, complete parameters and functionalities, and straightforward application and operation to minimize user cognitive load.
